# **:cyclone:  Pokemon Text Adventure v1.0**
This a short but sweet text adventure based off of a child classic Pokemon. It includes a standard text adventure setup
where you are prompted for an input based off the situation. However the twist is there is a battle portion that mirros
the classic Pokemon Battle UI. in the 1.1 drop of this game I intend to add Grass to walk through and wild pokemon
to capture and put into storage.

## **Getting Started**
git clone the entire repository into local storage and using terminal commands change the directory to /Pokemon.
Finally run story.py file using python. In my case I am using Python3.

```aidl
$ git clone 
$ cd /Pokemon
$ python3 story.py
```
